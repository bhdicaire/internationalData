Using name to identify international items are a pain. The information will change depending on the language being used thus it's harder to consolidate data from several sources. Using codes saves time and reduce errors related to typos.

InternationalData use a combination of letters and numbers that are understood all over the world. As I use this for my own projects, I know this might not be the perfect approach for you. If you have any ideas, just open an issue and tell me what you think ðŸ’¬.

I have the compiled the following information:
* Air â€” 
* Countries â€”  ISO 3166 country codes (2013 edition)
* Telephony â€” 
* Holidays â€” 
* Time â€” 
## Data format
In order to use the compiled data effectively, I provide it in multiple formats:
* Comma Separated Variable [(CSV)](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt);
* JavaScript Object Notation [(JSON)](https://www.json.org/);
* Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language [(TOML)](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml);
* Extensible Markup Language [(XML)](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/)
* YAML Ain't Markup Language [(YAML)](http://yaml.org/);

## Countries

### ISO 3166 country codes (2020 edition)

[ISO 3166 is the International Standard for country codes](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html), codes for subdivisions and formerly used codes (codes that were once used to describe countries but are no longer in use).

The country codes can be represented either as a two-letter code (alpha-2) which is recommended as the general purpose code, a three-letter code (alpha-3) which is more closely related to the country name and a three digit numeric code (numeric -3) which can be useful if you need to avoid using Latin script.

## Internet Domain Names

The [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/) is an initiative of [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/), but is maintained as a community resource as a [list of all known public suffixes](https://publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat). A _public suffix_ is one under which Internet users can directly register an internet domain name such as `Dicaire.com`under the `.com`top level domain (TLD).

Rather than juggle TLDs, gTLDs, or ccTLDs yourself, A public suffix is also sometimes called an effective TLD (eTLD).

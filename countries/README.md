# Countries

## United Nation country names
The [United Nations (UN) group of experts on geographical names ](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/UNGEGN/docs/26th-gegn-docs/WP/WP54_UNGEGN%20WG%20Country%20Names%20Document%202011.pdf) document the short and the formal countries names for the official national languages and the UN official languages (e.g. English, French, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, and Arabic).

## ISO 3166 country codes (2013 edition)

[ISO 3166 is the International Standard for country codes](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html), codes for subdivisions and formerly used codes (codes that were once used to describe countries but are no longer in use).

The country codes can be represented either as a two-letter code (alpha-2) which is recommended as the general purpose code, a three-letter code (alpha-3) which is more closely related to the country name and a three digit numeric code (numeric -3) which can be useful if you need to avoid using Latin script.

Names and codes for subdivisions are usually taken from relevant official national information sources.
